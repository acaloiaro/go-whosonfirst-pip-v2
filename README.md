# go-whosonfirst-pip-v2

An in-memory point-in-polygon (reverse geocoding) package for GeoJSON data, principally Who's On First data.

_This package supersedes the [go-whosonfirst-pip](https://github.com/whosonfirst/go-whosonfirst-pip) package which is (almost, if you're reading this) no longer maintained._

## Install

You will need to have both `Go` (specifically a version of Go more recent than 1.7 so let's just assume you need [Go 1.9](https://golang.org/dl/) or higher) and the `make` programs installed on your computer. Assuming you do just type:

```
make bin
```

All of this package's dependencies are bundled with the code in the `vendor` directory.
